# Rocket.Chat Apps TypeScript Definitions - ⚠️ DEPRECATED

This package was merged into https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine, please refer to it for issues and contributions.
You can find the code we had here at https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine/tree/master/src/definition.

The npm package `@rocket.chat/apps-ts-definition` will be updated for some time but it was deprecated and we enforce the usage of `@rocket.chat/apps-engine`.
