# temporary-rocketlets-ts-definition
This is the temporary home of the Rocketlets TypeScript definition repository.
It started out as a place to test some ideas for it then quickly evolved to a discussion area.

Please feel free to jump into any of the converstations, however please read the following links as they contain background information and ideas regarding Rocketlets.

- GitHub issue: "External applications as plug-ins (fka "API for AI providers")": [https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/6890](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/6890)
- Google Document: referred to as "brain dump doc": [https://docs.google.com/a/rocket.chat/document/d/1qLpXYRkvYT8CVw9xV98jyBCwZdxU_0YnDNGzWFXXXM4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/a/rocket.chat/document/d/1qLpXYRkvYT8CVw9xV98jyBCwZdxU_0YnDNGzWFXXXM4/edit?usp=sharing)
